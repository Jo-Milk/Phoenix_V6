# Phoenix_V6
Phoenix_V6.sprx Black Ops 1 (bo1) mod menu for Zombies utilizing iMCSx T5GSCLoader. 
However the goal is to pay hommage to one of my favorite mod menu Phoenix V5 by Alpatch649 from call of duty World at War (2008) by improving it but remain inspired by it.
Why on PS3? I loved Black Ops and this menu is just a hobby to get back into modding slowly after a long break. I will open source the project feel free to contribute.

I will try to make it for HEN but ATM it is for CFW on DEX with TMAPI.


Replace Eboot 1.13

Place Jo-Milk folder and it's content in tmp directory on the modded PS3

Place Phoenix_V6.sprx in tmp root

Sincerly your friend Jo-Milk
